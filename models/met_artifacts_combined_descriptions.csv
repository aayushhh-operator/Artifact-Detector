This rifle, made in 1901, years after Winchester released the more advanced Model 1894 and almost two decades after the Model 1886 was introduced, nevertheless testifies to the enduring popularity of Winchester’s products, and to wealthy customers’ willingness to spare little expense on their decoration.As the production of firearms became increasingly industrialized in the United States in the 1850s, customers seeking to personalize their machine-made guns could hire an independent gunsmith to add original embellishments, or, alternatively, choose from a variety of customization options executed by skilled decorators employed by the firearm’s manufacturer. This rifle was decorated at the Winchester factory, and its factory record specifies its upgrades from the standard model. It is an extra light takedown with a shotgun butt and rubber butt plate and a special hand-made stock with a pistol grip made of fancy walnut with high grain contrast and an oil finish, inset with a gold nameplate on the underside (Originally ""GH"", later replaced with ""OAW"" by a subsequent owner). The stock has Style D carving. It has a half magazine, sling swivels, and is fitted with Lyman Gun Sight Company rear and jack sights. It has Style No. 2 engraving with a fancy dull finish.The engraving and carving Style types refer to patterns illustrated in the Winchester Arms Company’s catalogueHighly Finished Arms. First published in 1897,Highly Finished Armscodified for the first time Winchester’s factory decoration options for its line of rifles, offering Winchester customers ten design options for receiver decoration and eight for the stock at varying price points. They include game scenes surrounded by scrollwork, and foliage motifs combined with scrollwork, with the option to customize for an added cost. The designs were conceived primarily by Winchester factory engravers Herman Leslie Ulrich (1846–1937) and William E. Stokes. The Museum’s rifle’s Style No. 1 engraving is the second most expensive available, and its Style D stock carving which combines checkering and oak leaves was a popular option on Model 1886s and later models.The rifle’s blued and casehardened receiver, finger lever, and barrel are engraved with scrollwork and inlaid with gold wire framing two gold-inlaid game scenes of a moose and two deer. Though traditionally regarded as ""American"" in style, such decorations found on Winchester rifles and many other American machine-made firearms of the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century are in fact international in nature, reflecting the training and taste of the German-born engravers who emigrated to the United States around the middle of the century and headed the decorative operations at America’s largest firearms manufacturers, including the Ulrich family and Gustave Young. This rifle’s game and hunting scenes, and indeed many of the standard hunting and game scenes offered by Winchester, draw direct inspiration from specific northern European iconographic sources, including the 1856 pattern book by the Belgian artist Charles Claesen,Recueil d’ornements et de sujets pour etre appliques a l’ornamentation des armes d’apres les dessins pircipaux artistes. The inspiration for the profusion of scrollwork found on embellished Winchester rifles, Colt pistols, and guns by other major American manufacturers, too, traces to northern Europe, chiefly the work of Gustav Ernst of Zella, who produced six influential pattern books between 1839–53 widely used by gun engravers in America. A copy of Ernst’s pattern bookMusterblätter enthaltend die anwendbarsten Jagdstücke u. Arabesken für Büchsenschäfter, Graveure etc.of 1850 owned by the famous firearms engraver Louis Daniel Nimschke (1832–1904) is part of The Met’s collection (acc. no. 2002.233.1a–j).The Model 1886 represents a milestone in Winchester’s history as it was the first rifle designed for the company by John Moses Browning (1855–1926). Browning’s designs led to the development of nine Winchester rifle models in total over the course of fifteen years, including the company’s most popular rifle, the Model 1894. Browning’s Model 1886 introduced significant improvements to the company’s previous lever action rifle, the Model 1876. These included an improved, stronger locking system with two vertical lug nuts interfacing with the bolt and receiver, an improved elevator system, new safety mechanisms, and better insulation from dust and debris.This rifle is one of three deluxe factory-decorated Winchesters given to the Museum by the Robert M. Lee Foundation in 2018 (acc. nos. 2018.856.5a–j; 2018.856.6)—the first factory-decorated Winchesters to enter the collection.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/788202/2004370/main-image,2018.856.4

(1854 g),Firearms-Guns-Wheellock,"With their elegant form, innovative use of materials, and imaginative ornament, French firearms were trend-setters throughout Europe from the early seventeenth to mid-nineteenth century. French influence in firearms design was spread in several ways: by the lavish gifting of firearms as part of French diplomatic practice; the publication in Paris of numerous engraved pattern books of firearms ornament; and the wide dispersal of Huguenot (Protestant) gunmakers after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1683. The rise of French gunmaking to its pre-eminent position did not happen overnight, however, but had its origins in the sixteenth century. This whellock pistol, a rare example of high quality French gunmaking before 1600, epitomizes this early, innovative stage.The pistol’s long, slender lines, small-caliber barrel, and distinctive wheellock mechanism are characteristic French features. So too is the elegant and sophisticated decoration. The barrel is chiseled in low relief at the breech end with strapwork, foliage, and a terme, the ornament gilt overall. Forward of this section, the smooth surface is engraved with emblems that include the fleur-de-lis, a flaming heart, an arrow entwined by a serpent that were gilt on a heat-blued ground, the colors now faded. The lockplate is worked in relief at its rear point with the head of a fierce dog with bared teeth, the head of the cock is fashioned as a horse’s head, and the wheel is fitted with a guide in the form of a siren. The wood stock is densely inlaid with shaped and engraved pieces of white staghorn, some stained green, and mother-of-pearl formed as dragons, putti, and grotesques, a type of embellishment that reflects—more in the choice of materials than style—the influence of contemporary German firearms. The pistol’s metal buttcap of ‘fishtail’ shape that is quite different from the spherical or ovoid butt common to most European pistols of the period. On this example, the buttcap is of copper alloy, the sides chiseled and engraved with an armed nude putto on one side and the helmeted head of a hero on the other, with, on the flat end, an embossed mask of a draped female head of Fontainebleau inspiration, the whole formerly gilt overall. A mere half-dozen French wheellock pistols are recorded with these distinctive metal butts, including another in The Met’s collection (acc. no. 14.25.1431), but it is unclear if they originated in the same workshop.Highly decorated weapons were usually made for men of wealth and status, but few are sufficiently marked as to provide evidence of the maker, date of manufacture, and identity of the original owner. Collectors often fill in these gaps with hopeful attributions and associations that, upon close inspection are not justified. This pistol was formerly thought to have been made in the workshop of the famous Le Bourgeois family of gunmakers active in Lisieux, in Normandy, in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century for King Henry IV of France (r. 1590–1610). Unfortunately, the maker’s mark struck on the lockplate is partly defaced and, while it includes the letter B, does not conform to any of the recorded marks used by the brothers Le Bourgeois. Similarly, while the barrel decoration includes a French fleur-de-lis and the buttplate bears a decorative motif that was once interpreted to be the letter H, there are no obvious reasons to associate the pistol with the Bourbon monarch. The unusual emblems on the barrel were undoubtedly of some personal importance to the owner, but emblems in that period were often purposely enigmatic. They continue to retain their secret.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/788261/1920872/main-image,2018.856.9

Ceremonial Mace,18th century,Indian,"Rock crystal, gold, copper alloy, ruby",L. 21 in. (53.4 cm); Diam. of head 2 in. (5 cm); Wt. 1 lb. 6 oz. (636 g),Shafted Weapons,"This ceremonial mace is a rare example fashioned entirely from rock crystal. Rock crystal was often carved to produce luxurious objects, including an Islamic, perhaps Fatimid, mace that became part of the Hungarian royal regalia. Several detached rock-crystal mace heads are known, among them a probably tenth- to eleventh-century Iranian example in the Metropolitan Museum's collection (acc. no. 1981.86).Most likely from Mughal India, this mace has a haft that is decorated in a style found on several Indian maces and axes now in the Wallace Collection, London (nos. 1563 and 1595). A very similar ovoid head is on an all-steel Indian mace dated 1880 and now in the Khalili Collection, London (no. MTW 1130). The ovoid shape, however, is not confined to India; similar mace heads are known from Bukhara as well. Much earlier examples of ovoid mace heads exist, probably from the eleventh or twelfth century, among them a Seljuq mace in the Furusiyya Art Foundation, Vaduz (no. R-101). It is likely that this is a Central Asian type imported into India by the Mughals, who originally came from Bukhara.The debased acanthus leaves with which the rock-crystal shaft of this example is decorated preclude a dating to the grand period of Mughal art during the seventeenth century. Consequently a later dating, provisionally to the eighteenth century, is suggested.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/24423/61306/main-image,36.25.1884

Winchester Model 1886 Takedown Rifle (serial no. 125176),1901,"American, New Haven, Connecticut","Steel, gold, platinum, wood (walnut)",L. 40 5/16 in. (102.4 cm); L. of barrel 20 15/16 in. (53.2 cm); Cal. .45 in. (11.4 mm) [.45–.70]; Wt. 7 lb. 12.6 oz. (3532 g),Firearms-Guns,"This factory engraved and gold- and platinum-inlaid Model 1886 rifle fitted with a complement of special-order features exemplifies the upper tier of Winchester’s embellished and customized firearms at the turn of the century. Though the Model 1886 remained in production until 1935 few deluxe Model 1886 rifles were made after 1900. This rifle, made in 1901, years after Winchester released the more advanced Model 1894 and almost two decades after the Model 1886 was introduced, nevertheless testifies to the enduring popularity of Winchester’s products, and to wealthy customers’ willingness to spare little expense on their decoration.As the production of firearms became increasingly industrialized in the United States in the 1850s, customers seeking to personalize their machine-made guns could hire an independent gunsmith to add original embellishments, or, alternatively, choose from a variety of customization options executed by skilled decorators employed by the firearm’s manufacturer. This rifle was decorated at the Winchester factory, and its factory record specifies its upgrades from the standard model. It is an extra light takedown with a shotgun butt and rubber butt plate and a special hand-made stock with a pistol grip made of fancy walnut with high grain contrast and an oil finish, inset with a gold nameplate on the underside (Originally ""GH"", later replaced with ""OAW"" by a subsequent owner). The stock has Style D carving. It has a half magazine, sling swivels, and is fitted with Lyman Gun Sight Company rear and jack sights. It has Style No. 2 engraving with a fancy dull finish.The engraving and carving Style types refer to patterns illustrated in the Winchester Arms Company’s catalogueHighly Finished Arms. First published in 1897,Highly Finished Armscodified for the first time Winchester’s factory decoration options for its line of rifles, offering Winchester customers ten design options for receiver decoration and eight for the stock at varying price points. They include game scenes surrounded by scrollwork, and foliage motifs combined with scrollwork, with the option to customize for an added cost. The designs were conceived primarily by Winchester factory engravers Herman Leslie Ulrich (1846–1937) and William E. Stokes. The Museum’s rifle’s Style No. 1 engraving is the second most expensive available, and its Style D stock carving which combines checkering and oak leaves was a popular option on Model 1886s and later models.The rifle’s blued and casehardened receiver, finger lever, and barrel are engraved with scrollwork and inlaid with gold wire framing two gold-inlaid game scenes of a moose and two deer. Though traditionally regarded as ""American"" in style, such decorations found on Winchester rifles and many other American machine-made firearms of the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century are in fact international in nature, reflecting the training and taste of the German-born engravers who emigrated to the United States around the middle of the century and headed the decorative operations at America’s largest firearms manufacturers, including the Ulrich family and Gustave Young. This rifle’s game and hunting scenes, and indeed many of the standard hunting and game scenes offered by Winchester, draw direct inspiration from specific northern European iconographic sources, including the 1856 pattern book by the Belgian artist Charles Claesen,Recueil d’ornements et de sujets pour etre appliques a l’ornamentation des armes d’apres les dessins pircipaux artistes. The inspiration for the profusion of scrollwork found on embellished Winchester rifles, Colt pistols, and guns by other major American manufacturers, too, traces to northern Europe, chiefly the work of Gustav Ernst of Zella, who produced six influential pattern books between 1839–53 widely used by gun engravers in America. A copy of Ernst’s pattern bookMusterblätter enthaltend die anwendbarsten Jagdstücke u. Arabesken für Büchsenschäfter, Graveure etc.of 1850 owned by the famous firearms engraver Louis Daniel Nimschke (1832–1904) is part of The Met’s collection (acc. no. 2002.233.1a–j).The Model 1886 represents a milestone in Winchester’s history as it was the first rifle designed for the company by John Moses Browning (1855–1926). Browning’s designs led to the development of nine Winchester rifle models in total over the course of fifteen years, including the company’s most popular rifle, the Model 1894. Browning’s Model 1886 introduced significant improvements to the company’s previous lever action rifle, the Model 1876. These included an improved, stronger locking system with two vertical lug nuts interfacing with the bolt and receiver, an improved elevator system, new safety mechanisms, and better insulation from dust and debris.This rifle is one of three deluxe factory-decorated Winchesters given to the Museum by the Robert M. Lee Foundation in 2018 (acc. nos. 2018.856.5a–j; 2018.856.6)—the first factory-decorated Winchesters to enter the collection.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/788202/2004370/main-image,2018.856.4

(1854 g),Firearms-Guns-Wheellock,"With their elegant form, innovative use of materials, and imaginative ornament, French firearms were trend-setters throughout Europe from the early seventeenth to mid-nineteenth century. French influence in firearms design was spread in several ways: by the lavish gifting of firearms as part of French diplomatic practice; the publication in Paris of numerous engraved pattern books of firearms ornament; and the wide dispersal of Huguenot (Protestant) gunmakers after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1683. The rise of French gunmaking to its pre-eminent position did not happen overnight, however, but had its origins in the sixteenth century. This whellock pistol, a rare example of high quality French gunmaking before 1600, epitomizes this early, innovative stage.The pistol’s long, slender lines, small-caliber barrel, and distinctive wheellock mechanism are characteristic French features. So too is the elegant and sophisticated decoration. The barrel is chiseled in low relief at the breech end with strapwork, foliage, and a terme, the ornament gilt overall. Forward of this section, the smooth surface is engraved with emblems that include the fleur-de-lis, a flaming heart, an arrow entwined by a serpent that were gilt on a heat-blued ground, the colors now faded. The lockplate is worked in relief at its rear point with the head of a fierce dog with bared teeth, the head of the cock is fashioned as a horse’s head, and the wheel is fitted with a guide in the form of a siren. The wood stock is densely inlaid with shaped and engraved pieces of white staghorn, some stained green, and mother-of-pearl formed as dragons, putti, and grotesques, a type of embellishment that reflects—more in the choice of materials than style—the influence of contemporary German firearms. The pistol’s metal buttcap of ‘fishtail’ shape that is quite different from the spherical or ovoid butt common to most European pistols of the period. On this example, the buttcap is of copper alloy, the sides chiseled and engraved with an armed nude putto on one side and the helmeted head of a hero on the other, with, on the flat end, an embossed mask of a draped female head of Fontainebleau inspiration, the whole formerly gilt overall. A mere half-dozen French wheellock pistols are recorded with these distinctive metal butts, including another in The Met’s collection (acc. no. 14.25.1431), but it is unclear if they originated in the same workshop.Highly decorated weapons were usually made for men of wealth and status, but few are sufficiently marked as to provide evidence of the maker, date of manufacture, and identity of the original owner. Collectors often fill in these gaps with hopeful attributions and associations that, upon close inspection are not justified. This pistol was formerly thought to have been made in the workshop of the famous Le Bourgeois family of gunmakers active in Lisieux, in Normandy, in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century for King Henry IV of France (r. 1590–1610). Unfortunately, the maker’s mark struck on the lockplate is partly defaced and, while it includes the letter B, does not conform to any of the recorded marks used by the brothers Le Bourgeois. Similarly, while the barrel decoration includes a French fleur-de-lis and the buttplate bears a decorative motif that was once interpreted to be the letter H, there are no obvious reasons to associate the pistol with the Bourbon monarch. The unusual emblems on the barrel were undoubtedly of some personal importance to the owner, but emblems in that period were often purposely enigmatic. They continue to retain their secret.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/788261/1920872/main-image,2018.856.9

(636 g),Shafted Weapons,"This ceremonial mace is a rare example fashioned entirely from rock crystal. Rock crystal was often carved to produce luxurious objects, including an Islamic, perhaps Fatimid, mace that became part of the Hungarian royal regalia. Several detached rock-crystal mace heads are known, among them a probably tenth- to eleventh-century Iranian example in the Metropolitan Museum's collection (acc. no. 1981.86).Most likely from Mughal India, this mace has a haft that is decorated in a style found on several Indian maces and axes now in the Wallace Collection, London (nos. 1563 and 1595). A very similar ovoid head is on an all-steel Indian mace dated 1880 and now in the Khalili Collection, London (no. MTW 1130). The ovoid shape, however, is not confined to India; similar mace heads are known from Bukhara as well. Much earlier examples of ovoid mace heads exist, probably from the eleventh or twelfth century, among them a Seljuq mace in the Furusiyya Art Foundation, Vaduz (no. R-101). It is likely that this is a Central Asian type imported into India by the Mughals, who originally came from Bukhara.The debased acanthus leaves with which the rock-crystal shaft of this example is decorated preclude a dating to the grand period of Mughal art during the seventeenth century. Consequently a later dating, provisionally to the eighteenth century, is suggested.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/24423/61306/main-image,36.25.1884

Winchester Model 1886 Takedown Rifle (serial no. 125176),1901,"American, New Haven, Connecticut","Steel, gold, platinum, wood (walnut)",L. 40 5/16 in. (102.4 cm); L. of barrel 20 15/16 in. (53.2 cm); Cal. .45 in. (11.4 mm) [.45–.70]; Wt. 7 lb. 12.6 oz. (3532 g),Firearms-Guns,"This factory engraved and gold- and platinum-inlaid Model 1886 rifle fitted with a complement of special-order features exemplifies the upper tier of Winchester’s embellished and customized firearms at the turn of the century. Though the Model 1886 remained in production until 1935 few deluxe Model 1886 rifles were made after 1900. This rifle, made in 1901, years after Winchester released the more advanced Model 1894 and almost two decades after the Model 1886 was introduced, nevertheless testifies to the enduring popularity of Winchester’s products, and to wealthy customers’ willingness to spare little expense on their decoration.As the production of firearms became increasingly industrialized in the United States in the 1850s, customers seeking to personalize their machine-made guns could hire an independent gunsmith to add original embellishments, or, alternatively, choose from a variety of customization options executed by skilled decorators employed by the firearm’s manufacturer. This rifle was decorated at the Winchester factory, and its factory record specifies its upgrades from the standard model. It is an extra light takedown with a shotgun butt and rubber butt plate and a special hand-made stock with a pistol grip made of fancy walnut with high grain contrast and an oil finish, inset with a gold nameplate on the underside (Originally ""GH"", later replaced with ""OAW"" by a subsequent owner). The stock has Style D carving. It has a half magazine, sling swivels, and is fitted with Lyman Gun Sight Company rear and jack sights. It has Style No. 2 engraving with a fancy dull finish.The engraving and carving Style types refer to patterns illustrated in the Winchester Arms Company’s catalogueHighly Finished Arms. First published in 1897,Highly Finished Armscodified for the first time Winchester’s factory decoration options for its line of rifles, offering Winchester customers ten design options for receiver decoration and eight for the stock at varying price points. They include game scenes surrounded by scrollwork, and foliage motifs combined with scrollwork, with the option to customize for an added cost. The designs were conceived primarily by Winchester factory engravers Herman Leslie Ulrich (1846–1937) and William E. Stokes. The Museum’s rifle’s Style No. 1 engraving is the second most expensive available, and its Style D stock carving which combines checkering and oak leaves was a popular option on Model 1886s and later models.The rifle’s blued and casehardened receiver, finger lever, and barrel are engraved with scrollwork and inlaid with gold wire framing two gold-inlaid game scenes of a moose and two deer. Though traditionally regarded as ""American"" in style, such decorations found on Winchester rifles and many other American machine-made firearms of the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century are in fact international in nature, reflecting the training and taste of the German-born engravers who emigrated to the United States around the middle of the century and headed the decorative operations at America’s largest firearms manufacturers, including the Ulrich family and Gustave Young. This rifle’s game and hunting scenes, and indeed many of the standard hunting and game scenes offered by Winchester, draw direct inspiration from specific northern European iconographic sources, including the 1856 pattern book by the Belgian artist Charles Claesen,Recueil d’ornements et de sujets pour etre appliques a l’ornamentation des armes d’apres les dessins pircipaux artistes. The inspiration for the profusion of scrollwork found on embellished Winchester rifles, Colt pistols, and guns by other major American manufacturers, too, traces to northern Europe, chiefly the work of Gustav Ernst of Zella, who produced six influential pattern books between 1839–53 widely used by gun engravers in America. A copy of Ernst’s pattern bookMusterblätter enthaltend die anwendbarsten Jagdstücke u. Arabesken für Büchsenschäfter, Graveure etc.of 1850 owned by the famous firearms engraver Louis Daniel Nimschke (1832–1904) is part of The Met’s collection (acc. no. 2002.233.1a–j).The Model 1886 represents a milestone in Winchester’s history as it was the first rifle designed for the company by John Moses Browning (1855–1926). Browning’s designs led to the development of nine Winchester rifle models in total over the course of fifteen years, including the company’s most popular rifle, the Model 1894. Browning’s Model 1886 introduced significant improvements to the company’s previous lever action rifle, the Model 1876. These included an improved, stronger locking system with two vertical lug nuts interfacing with the bolt and receiver, an improved elevator system, new safety mechanisms, and better insulation from dust and debris.This rifle is one of three deluxe factory-decorated Winchesters given to the Museum by the Robert M. Lee Foundation in 2018 (acc. nos. 2018.856.5a–j; 2018.856.6)—the first factory-decorated Winchesters to enter the collection.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/788202/2004370/main-image,2018.856.4

(1854 g),Firearms-Guns-Wheellock,"With their elegant form, innovative use of materials, and imaginative ornament, French firearms were trend-setters throughout Europe from the early seventeenth to mid-nineteenth century. French influence in firearms design was spread in several ways: by the lavish gifting of firearms as part of French diplomatic practice; the publication in Paris of numerous engraved pattern books of firearms ornament; and the wide dispersal of Huguenot (Protestant) gunmakers after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1683. The rise of French gunmaking to its pre-eminent position did not happen overnight, however, but had its origins in the sixteenth century. This whellock pistol, a rare example of high quality French gunmaking before 1600, epitomizes this early, innovative stage.The pistol’s long, slender lines, small-caliber barrel, and distinctive wheellock mechanism are characteristic French features. So too is the elegant and sophisticated decoration. The barrel is chiseled in low relief at the breech end with strapwork, foliage, and a terme, the ornament gilt overall. Forward of this section, the smooth surface is engraved with emblems that include the fleur-de-lis, a flaming heart, an arrow entwined by a serpent that were gilt on a heat-blued ground, the colors now faded. The lockplate is worked in relief at its rear point with the head of a fierce dog with bared teeth, the head of the cock is fashioned as a horse’s head, and the wheel is fitted with a guide in the form of a siren. The wood stock is densely inlaid with shaped and engraved pieces of white staghorn, some stained green, and mother-of-pearl formed as dragons, putti, and grotesques, a type of embellishment that reflects—more in the choice of materials than style—the influence of contemporary German firearms. The pistol’s metal buttcap of ‘fishtail’ shape that is quite different from the spherical or ovoid butt common to most European pistols of the period. On this example, the buttcap is of copper alloy, the sides chiseled and engraved with an armed nude putto on one side and the helmeted head of a hero on the other, with, on the flat end, an embossed mask of a draped female head of Fontainebleau inspiration, the whole formerly gilt overall. A mere half-dozen French wheellock pistols are recorded with these distinctive metal butts, including another in The Met’s collection (acc. no. 14.25.1431), but it is unclear if they originated in the same workshop.Highly decorated weapons were usually made for men of wealth and status, but few are sufficiently marked as to provide evidence of the maker, date of manufacture, and identity of the original owner. Collectors often fill in these gaps with hopeful attributions and associations that, upon close inspection are not justified. This pistol was formerly thought to have been made in the workshop of the famous Le Bourgeois family of gunmakers active in Lisieux, in Normandy, in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century for King Henry IV of France (r. 1590–1610). Unfortunately, the maker’s mark struck on the lockplate is partly defaced and, while it includes the letter B, does not conform to any of the recorded marks used by the brothers Le Bourgeois. Similarly, while the barrel decoration includes a French fleur-de-lis and the buttplate bears a decorative motif that was once interpreted to be the letter H, there are no obvious reasons to associate the pistol with the Bourbon monarch. The unusual emblems on the barrel were undoubtedly of some personal importance to the owner, but emblems in that period were often purposely enigmatic. They continue to retain their secret.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/788261/1920872/main-image,2018.856.9

(636 g),Shafted Weapons,"This ceremonial mace is a rare example fashioned entirely from rock crystal. Rock crystal was often carved to produce luxurious objects, including an Islamic, perhaps Fatimid, mace that became part of the Hungarian royal regalia. Several detached rock-crystal mace heads are known, among them a probably tenth- to eleventh-century Iranian example in the Metropolitan Museum's collection (acc. no. 1981.86).Most likely from Mughal India, this mace has a haft that is decorated in a style found on several Indian maces and axes now in the Wallace Collection, London (nos. 1563 and 1595). A very similar ovoid head is on an all-steel Indian mace dated 1880 and now in the Khalili Collection, London (no. MTW 1130). The ovoid shape, however, is not confined to India; similar mace heads are known from Bukhara as well. Much earlier examples of ovoid mace heads exist, probably from the eleventh or twelfth century, among them a Seljuq mace in the Furusiyya Art Foundation, Vaduz (no. R-101). It is likely that this is a Central Asian type imported into India by the Mughals, who originally came from Bukhara.The debased acanthus leaves with which the rock-crystal shaft of this example is decorated preclude a dating to the grand period of Mughal art during the seventeenth century. Consequently a later dating, provisionally to the eighteenth century, is suggested.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/24423/61306/main-image,36.25.1884

The high quality of the metal casting is a direct inheritance of the metalworking skills displayed by Peruvian native populations before Spanish conquest.Introduced to South America by the Spanish in the 16th century, horses soon became an important element in the lives of many local populations, of both colonial and native origin. Because horses were highly valued, owners would dress them with beautiful and elaborate tack, especially during festivals or other celebrations.

Winchester Model 1886 Takedown Rifle (serial no. 125176),1901,"American, New Haven, Connecticut","Steel, gold, platinum, wood (walnut)",L. 40 5/16 in. (102.4 cm); L. of barrel 20 15/16 in. (53.2 cm); Cal. .45 in. (11.4 mm) [.45–.70]; Wt. 7 lb. 12.6 oz. (3532 g),Firearms-Guns,"This factory engraved and gold- and platinum-inlaid Model 1886 rifle fitted with a complement of special-order features exemplifies the upper tier of Winchester’s embellished and customized firearms at the turn of the century. Though the Model 1886 remained in production until 1935 few deluxe Model 1886 rifles were made after 1900. This rifle, made in 1901, years after Winchester released the more advanced Model 1894 and almost two decades after the Model 1886 was introduced, nevertheless testifies to the enduring popularity of Winchester’s products, and to wealthy customers’ willingness to spare little expense on their decoration.As the production of firearms became increasingly industrialized in the United States in the 1850s, customers seeking to personalize their machine-made guns could hire an independent gunsmith to add original embellishments, or, alternatively, choose from a variety of customization options executed by skilled decorators employed by the firearm’s manufacturer. This rifle was decorated at the Winchester factory, and its factory record specifies its upgrades from the standard model. It is an extra light takedown with a shotgun butt and rubber butt plate and a special hand-made stock with a pistol grip made of fancy walnut with high grain contrast and an oil finish, inset with a gold nameplate on the underside (Originally ""GH"", later replaced with ""OAW"" by a subsequent owner). The stock has Style D carving. It has a half magazine, sling swivels, and is fitted with Lyman Gun Sight Company rear and jack sights. It has Style No. 2 engraving with a fancy dull finish.The engraving and carving Style types refer to patterns illustrated in the Winchester Arms Company’s catalogueHighly Finished Arms. First published in 1897,Highly Finished Armscodified for the first time Winchester’s factory decoration options for its line of rifles, offering Winchester customers ten design options for receiver decoration and eight for the stock at varying price points. They include game scenes surrounded by scrollwork, and foliage motifs combined with scrollwork, with the option to customize for an added cost. The designs were conceived primarily by Winchester factory engravers Herman Leslie Ulrich (1846–1937) and William E. Stokes. The Museum’s rifle’s Style No. 1 engraving is the second most expensive available, and its Style D stock carving which combines checkering and oak leaves was a popular option on Model 1886s and later models.The rifle’s blued and casehardened receiver, finger lever, and barrel are engraved with scrollwork and inlaid with gold wire framing two gold-inlaid game scenes of a moose and two deer. Though traditionally regarded as ""American"" in style, such decorations found on Winchester rifles and many other American machine-made firearms of the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century are in fact international in nature, reflecting the training and taste of the German-born engravers who emigrated to the United States around the middle of the century and headed the decorative operations at America’s largest firearms manufacturers, including the Ulrich family and Gustave Young. This rifle’s game and hunting scenes, and indeed many of the standard hunting and game scenes offered by Winchester, draw direct inspiration from specific northern European iconographic sources, including the 1856 pattern book by the Belgian artist Charles Claesen,Recueil d’ornements et de sujets pour etre appliques a l’ornamentation des armes d’apres les dessins pircipaux artistes. The inspiration for the profusion of scrollwork found on embellished Winchester rifles, Colt pistols, and guns by other major American manufacturers, too, traces to northern Europe, chiefly the work of Gustav Ernst of Zella, who produced six influential pattern books between 1839–53 widely used by gun engravers in America. A copy of Ernst’s pattern bookMusterblätter enthaltend die anwendbarsten Jagdstücke u. Arabesken für Büchsenschäfter, Graveure etc.of 1850 owned by the famous firearms engraver Louis Daniel Nimschke (1832–1904) is part of The Met’s collection (acc. no. 2002.233.1a–j).The Model 1886 represents a milestone in Winchester’s history as it was the first rifle designed for the company by John Moses Browning (1855–1926). Browning’s designs led to the development of nine Winchester rifle models in total over the course of fifteen years, including the company’s most popular rifle, the Model 1894. Browning’s Model 1886 introduced significant improvements to the company’s previous lever action rifle, the Model 1876. These included an improved, stronger locking system with two vertical lug nuts interfacing with the bolt and receiver, an improved elevator system, new safety mechanisms, and better insulation from dust and debris.This rifle is one of three deluxe factory-decorated Winchesters given to the Museum by the Robert M. Lee Foundation in 2018 (acc. nos. 2018.856.5a–j; 2018.856.6)—the first factory-decorated Winchesters to enter the collection.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/788202/2004370/main-image,2018.856.4

(1854 g),Firearms-Guns-Wheellock,"With their elegant form, innovative use of materials, and imaginative ornament, French firearms were trend-setters throughout Europe from the early seventeenth to mid-nineteenth century. French influence in firearms design was spread in several ways: by the lavish gifting of firearms as part of French diplomatic practice; the publication in Paris of numerous engraved pattern books of firearms ornament; and the wide dispersal of Huguenot (Protestant) gunmakers after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1683. The rise of French gunmaking to its pre-eminent position did not happen overnight, however, but had its origins in the sixteenth century. This whellock pistol, a rare example of high quality French gunmaking before 1600, epitomizes this early, innovative stage.The pistol’s long, slender lines, small-caliber barrel, and distinctive wheellock mechanism are characteristic French features. So too is the elegant and sophisticated decoration. The barrel is chiseled in low relief at the breech end with strapwork, foliage, and a terme, the ornament gilt overall. Forward of this section, the smooth surface is engraved with emblems that include the fleur-de-lis, a flaming heart, an arrow entwined by a serpent that were gilt on a heat-blued ground, the colors now faded. The lockplate is worked in relief at its rear point with the head of a fierce dog with bared teeth, the head of the cock is fashioned as a horse’s head, and the wheel is fitted with a guide in the form of a siren. The wood stock is densely inlaid with shaped and engraved pieces of white staghorn, some stained green, and mother-of-pearl formed as dragons, putti, and grotesques, a type of embellishment that reflects—more in the choice of materials than style—the influence of contemporary German firearms. The pistol’s metal buttcap of ‘fishtail’ shape that is quite different from the spherical or ovoid butt common to most European pistols of the period. On this example, the buttcap is of copper alloy, the sides chiseled and engraved with an armed nude putto on one side and the helmeted head of a hero on the other, with, on the flat end, an embossed mask of a draped female head of Fontainebleau inspiration, the whole formerly gilt overall. A mere half-dozen French wheellock pistols are recorded with these distinctive metal butts, including another in The Met’s collection (acc. no. 14.25.1431), but it is unclear if they originated in the same workshop.Highly decorated weapons were usually made for men of wealth and status, but few are sufficiently marked as to provide evidence of the maker, date of manufacture, and identity of the original owner. Collectors often fill in these gaps with hopeful attributions and associations that, upon close inspection are not justified. This pistol was formerly thought to have been made in the workshop of the famous Le Bourgeois family of gunmakers active in Lisieux, in Normandy, in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century for King Henry IV of France (r. 1590–1610). Unfortunately, the maker’s mark struck on the lockplate is partly defaced and, while it includes the letter B, does not conform to any of the recorded marks used by the brothers Le Bourgeois. Similarly, while the barrel decoration includes a French fleur-de-lis and the buttplate bears a decorative motif that was once interpreted to be the letter H, there are no obvious reasons to associate the pistol with the Bourbon monarch. The unusual emblems on the barrel were undoubtedly of some personal importance to the owner, but emblems in that period were often purposely enigmatic. They continue to retain their secret.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/788261/1920872/main-image,2018.856.9

Ceremonial Mace,18th century,Indian,"Rock crystal, gold, copper alloy, ruby",L. 21 in. (53.4 cm); Diam. of head 2 in. (5 cm); Wt. 1 lb. 6 oz. (636 g),Shafted Weapons,"This ceremonial mace is a rare example fashioned entirely from rock crystal. Rock crystal was often carved to produce luxurious objects, including an Islamic, perhaps Fatimid, mace that became part of the Hungarian royal regalia. Several detached rock-crystal mace heads are known, among them a probably tenth- to eleventh-century Iranian example in the Metropolitan Museum's collection (acc. no. 1981.86).Most likely from Mughal India, this mace has a haft that is decorated in a style found on several Indian maces and axes now in the Wallace Collection, London (nos. 1563 and 1595). A very similar ovoid head is on an all-steel Indian mace dated 1880 and now in the Khalili Collection, London (no. MTW 1130). The ovoid shape, however, is not confined to India; similar mace heads are known from Bukhara as well. Much earlier examples of ovoid mace heads exist, probably from the eleventh or twelfth century, among them a Seljuq mace in the Furusiyya Art Foundation, Vaduz (no. R-101). It is likely that this is a Central Asian type imported into India by the Mughals, who originally came from Bukhara.The debased acanthus leaves with which the rock-crystal shaft of this example is decorated preclude a dating to the grand period of Mughal art during the seventeenth century. Consequently a later dating, provisionally to the eighteenth century, is suggested.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/24423/61306/main-image,36.25.1884

Winchester Model 1886 Takedown Rifle (serial no. 125176),1901,"American, New Haven, Connecticut","Steel, gold, platinum, wood (walnut)",L. 40 5/16 in. (102.4 cm); L. of barrel 20 15/16 in. (53.2 cm); Cal. .45 in. (11.4 mm) [.45–.70]; Wt. 7 lb. 12.6 oz. (3532 g),Firearms-Guns,"This factory engraved and gold- and platinum-inlaid Model 1886 rifle fitted with a complement of special-order features exemplifies the upper tier of Winchester’s embellished and customized firearms at the turn of the century. Though the Model 1886 remained in production until 1935 few deluxe Model 1886 rifles were made after 1900. This rifle, made in 1901, years after Winchester released the more advanced Model 1894 and almost two decades after the Model 1886 was introduced, nevertheless testifies to the enduring popularity of Winchester’s products, and to wealthy customers’ willingness to spare little expense on their decoration.As the production of firearms became increasingly industrialized in the United States in the 1850s, customers seeking to personalize their machine-made guns could hire an independent gunsmith to add original embellishments, or, alternatively, choose from a variety of customization options executed by skilled decorators employed by the firearm’s manufacturer. This rifle was decorated at the Winchester factory, and its factory record specifies its upgrades from the standard model. It is an extra light takedown with a shotgun butt and rubber butt plate and a special hand-made stock with a pistol grip made of fancy walnut with high grain contrast and an oil finish, inset with a gold nameplate on the underside (Originally ""GH"", later replaced with ""OAW"" by a subsequent owner). The stock has Style D carving. It has a half magazine, sling swivels, and is fitted with Lyman Gun Sight Company rear and jack sights. It has Style No. 2 engraving with a fancy dull finish.The engraving and carving Style types refer to patterns illustrated in the Winchester Arms Company’s catalogueHighly Finished Arms. First published in 1897,Highly Finished Armscodified for the first time Winchester’s factory decoration options for its line of rifles, offering Winchester customers ten design options for receiver decoration and eight for the stock at varying price points. They include game scenes surrounded by scrollwork, and foliage motifs combined with scrollwork, with the option to customize for an added cost. The designs were conceived primarily by Winchester factory engravers Herman Leslie Ulrich (1846–1937) and William E. Stokes. The Museum’s rifle’s Style No. 1 engraving is the second most expensive available, and its Style D stock carving which combines checkering and oak leaves was a popular option on Model 1886s and later models.The rifle’s blued and casehardened receiver, finger lever, and barrel are engraved with scrollwork and inlaid with gold wire framing two gold-inlaid game scenes of a moose and two deer. Though traditionally regarded as ""American"" in style, such decorations found on Winchester rifles and many other American machine-made firearms of the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century are in fact international in nature, reflecting the training and taste of the German-born engravers who emigrated to the United States around the middle of the century and headed the decorative operations at America’s largest firearms manufacturers, including the Ulrich family and Gustave Young. This rifle’s game and hunting scenes, and indeed many of the standard hunting and game scenes offered by Winchester, draw direct inspiration from specific northern European iconographic sources, including the 1856 pattern book by the Belgian artist Charles Claesen,Recueil d’ornements et de sujets pour etre appliques a l’ornamentation des armes d’apres les dessins pircipaux artistes. The inspiration for the profusion of scrollwork found on embellished Winchester rifles, Colt pistols, and guns by other major American manufacturers, too, traces to northern Europe, chiefly the work of Gustav Ernst of Zella, who produced six influential pattern books between 1839–53 widely used by gun engravers in America. A copy of Ernst’s pattern bookMusterblätter enthaltend die anwendbarsten Jagdstücke u. Arabesken für Büchsenschäfter, Graveure etc.of 1850 owned by the famous firearms engraver Louis Daniel Nimschke (1832–1904) is part of The Met’s collection (acc. no. 2002.233.1a–j).The Model 1886 represents a milestone in Winchester’s history as it was the first rifle designed for the company by John Moses Browning (1855–1926). Browning’s designs led to the development of nine Winchester rifle models in total over the course of fifteen years, including the company’s most popular rifle, the Model 1894. Browning’s Model 1886 introduced significant improvements to the company’s previous lever action rifle, the Model 1876. These included an improved, stronger locking system with two vertical lug nuts interfacing with the bolt and receiver, an improved elevator system, new safety mechanisms, and better insulation from dust and debris.This rifle is one of three deluxe factory-decorated Winchesters given to the Museum by the Robert M. Lee Foundation in 2018 (acc. nos. 2018.856.5a–j; 2018.856.6)—the first factory-decorated Winchesters to enter the collection.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/788202/2004370/main-image,2018.856.4

(1854 g),Firearms-Guns-Wheellock,"With their elegant form, innovative use of materials, and imaginative ornament, French firearms were trend-setters throughout Europe from the early seventeenth to mid-nineteenth century. French influence in firearms design was spread in several ways: by the lavish gifting of firearms as part of French diplomatic practice; the publication in Paris of numerous engraved pattern books of firearms ornament; and the wide dispersal of Huguenot (Protestant) gunmakers after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1683. The rise of French gunmaking to its pre-eminent position did not happen overnight, however, but had its origins in the sixteenth century. This whellock pistol, a rare example of high quality French gunmaking before 1600, epitomizes this early, innovative stage.The pistol’s long, slender lines, small-caliber barrel, and distinctive wheellock mechanism are characteristic French features. So too is the elegant and sophisticated decoration. The barrel is chiseled in low relief at the breech end with strapwork, foliage, and a terme, the ornament gilt overall. Forward of this section, the smooth surface is engraved with emblems that include the fleur-de-lis, a flaming heart, an arrow entwined by a serpent that were gilt on a heat-blued ground, the colors now faded. The lockplate is worked in relief at its rear point with the head of a fierce dog with bared teeth, the head of the cock is fashioned as a horse’s head, and the wheel is fitted with a guide in the form of a siren. The wood stock is densely inlaid with shaped and engraved pieces of white staghorn, some stained green, and mother-of-pearl formed as dragons, putti, and grotesques, a type of embellishment that reflects—more in the choice of materials than style—the influence of contemporary German firearms. The pistol’s metal buttcap of ‘fishtail’ shape that is quite different from the spherical or ovoid butt common to most European pistols of the period. On this example, the buttcap is of copper alloy, the sides chiseled and engraved with an armed nude putto on one side and the helmeted head of a hero on the other, with, on the flat end, an embossed mask of a draped female head of Fontainebleau inspiration, the whole formerly gilt overall. A mere half-dozen French wheellock pistols are recorded with these distinctive metal butts, including another in The Met’s collection (acc. no. 14.25.1431), but it is unclear if they originated in the same workshop.Highly decorated weapons were usually made for men of wealth and status, but few are sufficiently marked as to provide evidence of the maker, date of manufacture, and identity of the original owner. Collectors often fill in these gaps with hopeful attributions and associations that, upon close inspection are not justified. This pistol was formerly thought to have been made in the workshop of the famous Le Bourgeois family of gunmakers active in Lisieux, in Normandy, in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century for King Henry IV of France (r. 1590–1610). Unfortunately, the maker’s mark struck on the lockplate is partly defaced and, while it includes the letter B, does not conform to any of the recorded marks used by the brothers Le Bourgeois. Similarly, while the barrel decoration includes a French fleur-de-lis and the buttplate bears a decorative motif that was once interpreted to be the letter H, there are no obvious reasons to associate the pistol with the Bourbon monarch. The unusual emblems on the barrel were undoubtedly of some personal importance to the owner, but emblems in that period were often purposely enigmatic. They continue to retain their secret.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/788261/1920872/main-image,2018.856.9

Ceremonial Mace,18th century,Indian,"Rock crystal, gold, copper alloy, ruby",L. 21 in. (53.4 cm); Diam. of head 2 in. (5 cm); Wt. 1 lb. 6 oz. (636 g),Shafted Weapons,"This ceremonial mace is a rare example fashioned entirely from rock crystal. Rock crystal was often carved to produce luxurious objects, including an Islamic, perhaps Fatimid, mace that became part of the Hungarian royal regalia. Several detached rock-crystal mace heads are known, among them a probably tenth- to eleventh-century Iranian example in the Metropolitan Museum's collection (acc. no. 1981.86).Most likely from Mughal India, this mace has a haft that is decorated in a style found on several Indian maces and axes now in the Wallace Collection, London (nos. 1563 and 1595). A very similar ovoid head is on an all-steel Indian mace dated 1880 and now in the Khalili Collection, London (no. MTW 1130). The ovoid shape, however, is not confined to India; similar mace heads are known from Bukhara as well. Much earlier examples of ovoid mace heads exist, probably from the eleventh or twelfth century, among them a Seljuq mace in the Furusiyya Art Foundation, Vaduz (no. R-101). It is likely that this is a Central Asian type imported into India by the Mughals, who originally came from Bukhara.The debased acanthus leaves with which the rock-crystal shaft of this example is decorated preclude a dating to the grand period of Mughal art during the seventeenth century. Consequently a later dating, provisionally to the eighteenth century, is suggested.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/24423/61306/main-image,36.25.1884
